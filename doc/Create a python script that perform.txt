Create a python script that performs the following:

Ingest a file with the naming convention of
787-2025-01-705-02-Schedule.csv where the name represents LeagueId-Year-SessionId-DivisionId-LocationId.csv Each of these values are integers.
The contents of the file are formatted as such:
	Header: MatchDate,HomeTeamId-AwayTeamId
	Example Values:
		1/19/25,1-2
		1/19/25,5-6
		1/19/25,3-4
		1/19/25,8-7
		4/20/25,No Play
		4/27/25,6-1
		4/27/25,2-5
		4/27/25,7-3
		4/27/25,4-8
		5/04/25,Playoff Week
		5/11/25,Playoff Week

The Division has 4 pairs of match tables.
The pairs are:
	1-2
	3-4
	5-6
	7-8

For each MatchDate, assign a pair of tables to each HomeTeam-AwayTeam

To assign tables, use the following logic:
	Neither a HomeTeam nor an AwayTeam can have played on the table pair the previous week.
	No team should play on a table pair significantly more than another team.

Ask me questions to clarify.
